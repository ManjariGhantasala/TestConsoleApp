# TestConsoleApp
# Unzip
Unzip and extract TestConsoleApp.zip file

# App.Config

replace "C:\CombinedLetters" with folder path of CombinedLetters from the current local system which contains fixed file folders like Input, Output & Archive

# Assumptions

Folder names in Combined letters eg-  "Input" are Case sensitve
File names in Dated folder in Admission & Scolarship folders are case sensitive eg - "Admission-12345" or "Scholarship-12345"

# Run

run the program [Run](TestConsoleApp.sln) in any Development Environment(eg: Visual Studio)

# Services

Services contain 2 methods Iletterservices and Letterservices dealing with combining paths & merge content in 2 text files with input file 1 preceding input file 2 content

# Hours Estd. vs Actual
Hours Estimated - 10hrs
Hours Actual - 11Hrs
* Over Projected my hours due to complicating various extended possibilities and solutions

# Project Details & Explanations

This project mainly demonstrates 3 basic algorithms 
i) Combining 2 text files 
ii)identifying 2 similar files 
iii)Generating a count report


# Assumptions For various test cases
1. If the admission letter is present & scholarship  letter is not present the total list of letters in output must have an admission letter for printing

2. Similarly if a scholarship letter is present but no admission letter then the total combined letters in output must contain scholarshipletters for printing

# Comments

Succeeded in printing the combinedletters but need to work on above assumptions exceptions


# Problems came across
1. Majority of the time there were debugging issues for similar syntax lines and working on above assumptions
